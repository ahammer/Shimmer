In the Eldoria Forest, Lyra the Forest Spirit seeks the party's help to reclaim her home from the invading shadows. She knows the paths through the forest that may lead to the forgotten ruins but will only lead them if they prove their worth against a lurking threat.  Sister Mira, within the Temple of the Holy Flame, has felt the extinguishing of their sacred flame. She believes that rekindling this flame will grant them divine favor against the shadow.
